In this vignette, we describe our helper function `rpluce` to simulate ranking data based on the Plackett-Luce model, also known as the rank-order logit or random utility model. To draw from the PL, `rpluce` requires a vector of probabilities that `t` items will be selected as the first choice, respectively. For each unit, the output provides a full ordering of `t` items with distinct alphabet letters.

```{r}
draw <- rpluce(n = 50,
               t = 4,
               prob = c(0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2))
head(draw)
```
