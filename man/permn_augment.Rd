\title{Augmenting Permutation Patterns}
\usage{
permn_augment(tab, J = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{A table of observed permutation patterns.}

\item{J}{The length of the reference choice set.
Defaults to NULL, in which it will count the number of characters
in the first input.}
}
\value{
A table of observed permutation patterns augmented with all possible
permutation patterns.
}
\description{
In some distribution of ranking data, not all possible permutation patterns
may be realized due to the sample size or skewed distribution of preferences.
}
\details{
This function augments the given table with all possible observed
permutation patterns with a frequency of zero for unrealized patterns.
Currently, this only takes full rankings into account, as opposed to partial
rankings.
}
\examples{
tab <- table(c(rep("123", 100), rep("321", 50)))
permn_augment(tab, J = 3)

tab <- table(c("123", "321", "213", "312", "132", "231"))
permn_augment(tab, J = 3)
