# `rankingQ`: Design-Based Methods for Improving Ranking Questions

`rankingQ` implements design-based methods for correcting measurement errors in ranking questions due to random responses. `rankingQ` allows users to estimate various ranking-based quantities of interest both non-parametrically and parametrically. `rankingQ` also offers practical tools for detecting the bias and assessing the anchor-ranking question.\
